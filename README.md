## Brute Forcing

This is the very simple C++ program that performs Brute Focing to crack the password

# Brute Forcing:
Trying every possible password until you find the correct one

# How it works:
- This program will check the every character until it matches with the original one
- Once it matches the original, it will show the password and number of attempt taken to find the password

# Features:
- Checking all letters
- Crack the original password
- Shows the Password
- Shows the Attempts

# Limitations:
This program is just made to crack the password that are single character and in lowercase, else it will display "Password not Cracked!"

# Why i made this project:
Learning Cyber Security concepts:
- Brute Forcing
- Learn password cracking
- Improving Logics
- Practicing C++

# Example Output:
- Set a password (small letters only): i
- Brute forcing...
- Password cracked!
- Your password was: i
- Attempts: 9
